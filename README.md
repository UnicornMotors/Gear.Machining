Make a Worm Gear for 1980's Ford Steering Gearbox: " SWTWHITEGSR 4 months ago I have done it all taken gearbox apart adjusted to the closest while not making it have tension against rack pinion which worm gear is in center. What I have found is that the actual play is in worm gear where bearings are at usually 24 ball bearings two different colors. Still trying to see how I can fix it I actually bought a lifetime rebuilt thinking they probably put a new worm gear and I was wrong . I have changed it all except worm gear seems no one sells a new worm gear.good video though very thorough." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-5Mn1RWT-s&amp;lc=UgxvczB_EaPFA7Tsk2l4AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=FintechRepairShop ; Make replacement Gears for Manual Transmissions
